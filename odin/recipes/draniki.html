    <ol>
        <li>How to make potato pancakes in a pan? Prepare the ingredients.
            Take a deep frying pan with a thick bottom and a lid.
            Wash potatoes, peel and grate on a medium grater.
            If desired, it is fashionable to squeeze the minced potato from the juice,
            rinse from excess starch, then the potato pancakes will turn out to be snow-white.
            But it is better not to do this, then potato pancakes will be more tasty, crispy and ruddy.</li>
        <li>Place the minced potato in a deep bowl. Add salt and black pepper to it to taste.
            Beat in one chicken egg.</li>
        <li>Stir the mass so that the chicken egg and spices mix with the minced potato.</li>
        <li>Add flour to potato mixture. Add it with a spoon in parts, mixing well each time to monitor the
            consistency of the dough.</li>
        <li>It should turn out quite thick, thicker than sour cream. Then pancakes will turn out plump and lush.
            Pour vegetable oil into a frying pan, heat it up.</li>
        <li>Spoon one tablespoon of the potato batter onto the pancake,
            smoothing the edges to keep the batter from spreading.
            When the potato dough sets well, forming a good crust on the bottom,
            cover the pan with a lid, make the fire medium and fry for about 10 minutes.
            Then remove the lid, fry the potato pancakes for about 5 minutes,
            then turn over and fry until golden brown on the second side. So fry each batch of potato pancakes.</li>
        <li>Remove them carefully with a wooden spatula on a plate covered with a napkin so that the remaining
            vegetable oil drains. Serve pancakes to the table with sour cream and fresh vegetables and herbs.
            Enjoy your meal!</li>
